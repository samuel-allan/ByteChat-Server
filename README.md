# ByteChat Server
## About
A ByteChat server is a node which helps keep our network decentralized and working throughout the world as well as providing block resistance in restricted countries. Hosting a low latency ByteChat server is the best way to contribute to the ByteChat network. In order to ensure that you are really helping the network, make sure that:
 - Your server is consistenly reachable
 - You have a static IP address
 - You have a high speed network (a speed of around 500KBytes-1MByte per second is ideal)
