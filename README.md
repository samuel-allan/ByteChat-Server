# ByteChat Server
## About
A ByteChat server is a node which helps keep our network decentralized and working throughout the world as well as providing block resistance in restricted countries. Hosting a low latency ByteChat server is the best way to contribute to the ByteChat network. In order to ensure that you are really helping the network, make sure that:
 - Your server is consistenly reachable
 - You have a static IP address
 - You have a high speed network (a speed of around 500KBytes-1MByte per second is ideal)
 
## Installation
Currently supported:
 - [ ] Linux VPS servers
 - [ ] Windows servers
 - [ ] Linux shared hosting servers
 
Currently nothing is supported, but this is only the beginning of development.

## How do I get my server listed?
Please send an email to [Address will be here in the future] with your server IP and the maximum load you are prepared to allow (if there isn't a limit let me know) you can also mention maximum bandwidth you would like to allocate. Alternatively the clients will soon support doing so directly (when you run the server it will let you know if it isn't listed).
